# Deep-Bellman-Hedging

A paper published in 2022, by Hans Buehler, an accomplished researcher in quantitative finance, discusses  a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamically hedging portfolios of financial instruments (e.g., securities, derivatives) using historical data. The approach is based on solving a Bellman equation to optimize hedging strategies in continuous state and action spaces, incorporating trading frictions (e.g., transaction costs, liquidity constraints) and risk-adjusted return objectives.
